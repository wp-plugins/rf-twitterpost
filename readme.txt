Submits a tweet to twitter whenever you publish a new post.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to tweet whenever you publish a new post.
You can customize the tweet message and include the title or url with tags %TITLE% or %URL% (respectively).
Twitter only allows up to 140 characters in a single tweet. Because of this restriction, if the format + tags cannot be more than 140 characters.
If you include the %URL% tag, it is given priority. If it cannot fit into the format because your text is to long then it will be excluded entriley.
If you include the %TITLE% tag and the post title causes the tweet to go over 140 characters, the plugin uses a substring of the post title, so it
will fit in the tweet.
